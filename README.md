The application uses PostgreSQL. Versions 8.2 and up are supported.
Create database and config file `config/database.yml` for connection.
File example:

    development:
      adapter: postgresql
      database: database_name
      pool: 5

There is `config/database_example.yml` file for full example.

Create file `config/application.yml` for app configuration management.
There is `config/application_example.yml` for example.

When done, run:

    $ bin/bundle install --without production
    $ bin/rake db:create db:migrate
